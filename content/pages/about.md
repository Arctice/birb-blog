Title: About
Status: published

Just a place to share thoughts about game design, built and envisioned by Arctice, with additional contributions by Uni. 

As anyone who actually found this blog already knows, I love writing about video games, so I'm excited about having a less transient place to put them. This won't be anything like a weekly review meat grinder, and the content will be the same as I've always posted to Twitter, but I'm hoping to get some more feedback from people now that there's an element of permanence. The goal is to improve my writing skill and branch out with my gaming, so if there's a game you really want me to look at, let me know. I'm always open to new things, even if my taste is characteristically narrow.

Love love love,

Uni


Love love love love,
